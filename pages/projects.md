# [Quantified Self](https://ai.eastonlee.com/status)

This project is inspired by the [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) movement, in which people are encouraged to observe themselves accurately and make new discoveries about themselves from quantified data.

This tool collects data such as facial emotion, active window on screen, text in windows and more, visualizes them and finds abnormality in real time. It sends me notification when any of the metrics goes wrong, so I can adjust myself to the best very quickly with help of this digital friend and mentor.

Behind the scenes it even knows what I'm reading every day and keeps doing the topic modeling to map the temporal shift of my interest.
